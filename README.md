## kamr.in is an inspiration blog run by Kamrin Klauschie. Expect quotes, books, photography, interior design, art, travel, nature, beauty, and fun.

# Background 💡
For years, the swissmiss (https://www.swiss-miss.com/) blog run by Tina Roth Eisenburg has been a design and inspiration staple in a healthy information diet for millions of designers and creatives. But why is it chronological? Typical chronological blog design is lame and outdated. It's time for a fresh and exciting re-invention of a classic. 

# Features 💣
- Isometric Background Layout (All Pages)
- Responsive CSS Only Masonry Layout (Home Page)
- SVG Images for Performant Styling (Colorful Blobs 🎨)
- CSS Only Transparent Text Gradient (Current Location, About Page 🌈)
- CSS Animation (Business Cards, About Page)
- Interactive Slider Cards (Projects and Media Cards, Portfolio Page)
- Pinterest API Integration
- New, Randomized Inspiration on Page Reload (🌱)

# Issues 🐛
