## kamr.in is an inspiration blog run by Kamrin Klauschie. Expect quotes, books, photography, interior design, art, travel, nature, beauty, and fun.

# Background 💡
For years, the swissmiss (https://www.swiss-miss.com/) blog run by Tina Roth Eisenburg has been a design and inspiration staple in a healthy information diet for millions of designers and creatives. But why is it chronological? Typical chronological blog design is lame and outdated. It's time for a fresh and exciting re-invention of a classic. 

#### Inspiration words: Colorful, Playful, Modern, Deep, Light, Dynamic, Exciting, Fun 

# Features 💣
- Isometric Background Layout (All Pages)
- Responsive CSS Only Masonry Layout (Home Page)
- SVG Images for Performant Styling (Colorful Blobs 🎨)
- CSS Only Transparent Text Gradient (Current Location, About Page 🌈)
- Pinterest API Integration
- New, Randomized Inspiration on Page Reload (🌱)

# Issues 🐛
- The colorful blobs placement (SVGs) need to be customized by page length for improved styling 
- Some images' quality and styling from my Pinterest account are bizarre or problematic (Ursula Burns has a Xerox label on the photo, an Interior Design image has the Instagram handle included in the image, etc.)
- There are only 4 long quotes, making that section very apt to repeat 
- The project needs to have copyrights and links to image sources on each card ASAP

# Roadmap 🗺️

### Deployed v1.0 🚦
- Inspiration Mode: fills a pre-determined slot (from a categorized Pinterest board imported into a Masonry slot on the Home page) with a randomized selection of curated content, selects new randomized content on page reload
- Inspiration Mode: on hover, Masonry card flips to reveal the card category in text on the back of the card, with a link to the Pin on click, using a custom color on the background of the card pulled through the Pinterest API
- Currently supported inspiration categories include Interior Design, Patterns & Textures, Short Quotes, Heroes, Libraries, Travel, Art, Plants, Long Quotes, and Coffee Shops

### Coming Soon v2.0 🚧
- Masonry Update: each card, on hover, flips to reveal the category, link to source, and any relevant copyright information on the back of the card
- Filter Mode: displays a selectable set of category labels and all of the currently stored instances of the selected category, can display multiple category labels together, simulates infinite scroll in a masonry layout 
- Mode Toggle: us an interactive toggle button on the Home page, the user is able to flip back and forth between Inspiration Mode and Filter Mode
- RSS Feed and Email Newsletter Subscription features (1 randomly generated set of inspiration emailed or shared per day)

### Coming Eventually v3.0 🚀
- Add more inspiration categories including Podcasts, Videos, Movies & Shows, Books, etc.
- Expand quality and volume of available content within v1.0 inspiration categories, especially more long quotes
